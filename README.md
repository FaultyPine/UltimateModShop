# UltimateModShop

A Nintendo Switch homebrew project that (will) manage user's installations of mods, and allow users to browse/install mods from Gamebanana.
Built using Natinusala's [Borealis](https://github.com/natinusala/borealis). Huge thanks to them!



## Building
See instructions for building from the borealis readme [here](https://github.com/natinusala/borealis).
And there are some additional compilation instructions at the [borealis wiki](https://github.com/natinusala/borealis/wiki/Additional-compilation-instructions).
(If you need help building it, let me know. Especially building for PC is a bit complicated)

As a side note, I know I should be using smart/shared pointers instead of tossing raw ones around. I'm purposely not switching to using those as a personal learning experience.
